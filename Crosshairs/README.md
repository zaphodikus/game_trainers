# Empyrion Galactic survival : crosshairs
![Some files](/Crosshairs/img/screenshot.png?raw=true)
In this folder I've basically dumped an example set of crosshair files ready to drag and drop into Unity and then create your bundle. A few already "compiled" or bundled crosshair files are included to get you going for now.

To go back to the Steam guide on how to create crosshairs and for how to use them in a scenario, click [Making crosshairs in Unity : for N00bs](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2386034807)
